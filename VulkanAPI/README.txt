GLFW-based Vulkan platform based on Sascha Willems github code (https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan)

I used Vulkan 1.0.61.1, and the other additional dependencies are in the the provided file named as such.

Two issues. One is window resizing. Second is the broken include, found in unused/need updating.
