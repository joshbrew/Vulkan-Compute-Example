GLFW-based Vulkan platform based on Sascha Willems github code (https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan)

I used Vulkan 1.0.61.1, and the other additional dependencies are in the the provided file named as such.

Two issues. One is window resizing.

Second, there are conflicting macro definitions for min and max that stop windows.h from working with gli. How do?!

The x64 file contains a broken .exe file. I can't figure out how to break the conflicts in the files.
